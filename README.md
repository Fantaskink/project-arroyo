# project-arroyo
FO2 remastered in the creation engine. We are a group of loyal fallout fans who would like to see "old fallout" and "new fallout" become one and the same. Please DM DocWhite#9295 if you are interested in joining our project

For now there are no limits on who can contribute as long as you are officially part of our project via Discord first but when submitting a pull request (more on that below) you must say what you changed with detail or we may have to denyt it since we're working with a file instead of source code and we can't risk not knowing what is or isn't in our master file.

**WTF? Dependency Mods? How do I use them?**

Anything in Dependencies/Data should be installed to your FO4's Data folder like you would any other mod. projectarroyo.esm uses these mods as parent masters so you WILL need them installed if you want to work on the mod in CK. On release we will eventually bundle the dependencies with the actual mod so players only have one download, but for now we keep it seperate in case we need to make changes or update a mod to a newer version.

**How to commit to this repository using esps**

This system is changing stand by
