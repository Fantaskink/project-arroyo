# project-arroyo
FO2 remastered in the creation engine. We are a group of loyal fallout fans who would like to see "old fallout" and "new fallout" become one and the same.

For now there are no limits on who can commit but you must say what you changed with detail or we may have to revert it since we're working with a file instead of source code.

**How to commit to this repository using esps**
Instructions coming soon to a readme file near you
